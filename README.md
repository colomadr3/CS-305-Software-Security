# CS-305-Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Our client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. They has a RESTful web application programming interface, so they are seeking our expertise about how to protect the organization from external threats by keeping their API current and secure.
    
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
We were able to address Artemis Financial's concerns and requirements. We evaluated their API and with the vulnerability assessment process flow diagram and ensured the web application was protected in all fronts. Secure code protects the data for the organization and their customers from attackers. Software security only protects the data stored with a company, it safeguards the company's reputation. Trust is a difficult thing to gain back once it is lost. Customers and investors want to know that they can trust a company they are providing their funds and data.  
    
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most difficult part for me was knowing where to start. The vulnerability assessment process flow diagram did not offer a lot of information. The categories were not explaned indepth, so I had to do lots of outside research to point me in the right direction. Overall it was positive, because it helped me see where I was lacking and pushed me to learn more.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
After I started understanding what I was doing, the vulnerability assessment process flow diagram was good at categorizing what to be aware (although each category was not well described). With each item evaluated and addressed, it added a layer of security for the overall software. I believe there needs to be a standard that I would follow. I would check the libraries, connections, certifates, coding patterns, etc. Once I got the basics out to the way I would delve deeper and see what needed my attention.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
There was a lot of testing involved. The major contributor to determine vulnerabilities was the OWASP dependency checker pluggin. This allowed me to determine vulnerabilities in the libraries of the code and gave insight into what I needed to address. It was a good starting point though it is a bit confusing at times.
    
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Knowing where to look is good start. The book helped to point me the right direction, but it still felt like I was going in blind. Being up-to-date with software security and understanding how it evolves is also very important. Continuing to research, check forums, read articles, etc. will help to increase your software security toolbox.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Artemis Financial, though fake, still needed secure code to protect the API and the data it was transfering. I was able to develop code that is transferable to other instances of SSL/TSL connections. I  learned skills though this assignment that I can implement with other companys that will produce secure code.
